# Pentadactyl Solarized Theme

This is a color scheme for the incredible [Pentadactyl][penta] add-on
for [Firefox][ff]. It uses the color palette [Solarized][solar],
designed by Ethan Schoonover.

This color scheme aims to be one of the most complete color schemes
available. Even the help has been styled!

This theme clears out all highlighting settings before applying its own
in order to avoid bleed over from other themes.

If you have a suggestion or find any bugs with the current
implementation, please enter an issue in the tracker:

If you appreciate the work done on this colorscheme, you could buy me a
